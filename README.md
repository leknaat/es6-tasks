# ES6
Take a look at theese ES6 Features we'll be using in the docs:
-let & const
-arrows
-template strings
-modules
-destructuring
-default + rest + spread 
-classes
-Object rest properties (ES7) 
-Object spread properties (ES7) 


For each feature, build an example of it working and look at the ES5 code that gets generated.
